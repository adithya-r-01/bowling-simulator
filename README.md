# Bowling Simulator

_This project is still very much a work in progress and much work needs to be done in order to have the physics engine compute friction properly, the application to perform its feedback loop properly, and also the aesthetic appeal_.

### Purpose

This `lua` ~~game~~ ~~application~~ engine intends on modeling the simple kinetic and dynamic properties underlying the game of Bowling. The analysis is done from a rotational and linear end. All-in-all the goal is to understand what the _optimal_ bowling strategy is with the conventional degrees of freedom

### Setup

This code is built of the `Love2D` engine (additional information can be found [here](https://love2d.org/)). To set it up locally follow the instructions on the site to install. To run the application drag the `main.lua` file into your newly created `Love2D` desktop shortcut.
